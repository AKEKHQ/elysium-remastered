# Elysium Remastered

> *An Opus Magnum of productive procrastination*

This started as me tinkering with game files to look busy during a conference. Then it spiraled. Two years and 26,000 lines of code later, it's a full overhaul.

Elysium Remastered revisits every class, plane, and system in the game. The goal was to keep the spirit of the original intact while making things feel more consistent, better balanced, and more replayable in the long term. Most changes follow the logic of **flavor first, mechanics second**. This isn't a content dump‚Äîwhere new content was added, it's because something felt missing.

## ‚ú® What's New

### General Improvements
- Balance, functionality and quality of life tweaks
- Lightning attacks scale less well, ant hills burn, ancient forests can be capped by all classes
- Many sprite upgrades pulled from Dominions and other community mods

### Class Overhauls
Every class has been touched to give each:
- **Clearer sense of identity**
- **Unique mechanics and new content**
- **Longer runway for late-game development**
- **Fewer filler rituals and useless units**
- **More even footing overall** (though still wildly asymmetrical)

#### Highlights
- **Markgraf** ‚Äî undead labor reforms, vampires, and vivisection
- **Witch** ‚Äî darker nature magic, Baba Yaga vibes, and a branching endgame
- **Scourge Lord** ‚Äî reworked into a Dark Sun/Arabian Nights villain
- **Enchanter & High Priestess** ‚Äî more sustainable playstyles, less terrain destruction
- **Necromancer** ‚Äî must find and exhume giant monster remains to reanimate them

### Expanded Planes and Exploration
- New monsters, terrain, and treasures across all planes
- **Agartha** feels like a real underdark: interconnected tunnels, slime pools, ancient ruins, buried gods
- **Sky Plane** is more alive, with higher resource density and reasons to conquer it
- **Celestial Realm, Inferno, Aztlan, and Primal Plane** have unique recruitment and better defended citadels

### AI Rework
- Smarter ritual use, better army composition, less suicide
- Builds thematic garrisons and levels mages properly
- Class-specific logic: Markgraf becomes a vampire, Baron gets crowned, Dwarf Queen actually works
