# Elysium Remastered Mod Overview

This is a rough overview of the mods content, enough to give a sense of what's inside and some of the thinking behind it. It's not exhaustive and probably not fully up to date. For the full picture, check the mod files or just play the game. 

Credits are included for any ported assets. I tried to be thorough, but I'm sure I missed a bunch. Let me know if something should be added. 

## Inspiration Sources

Inspiration for rituals, concepts etc. mostly came from here: 
- CoExpansion, COE5 Mod by Nethermind
- Large Overhaul, COE5 Mod by Alex the Beetrayer
- AXPmod, COE4 mod by JD (now also available for COE5)
- Necromantic Reorganization, Disenchanted Apprentices, COE5 mods by Oort Objects

## Sprite Sources

Sprites came from here: 
- The Gathering Sturm and Sturms Sprite Overhaul, Dominions mods by Sturm.
- Confluence + Legendary, Dominions mods by Executor
- Ny´s New Nations, Dominions mod by Nyaxe 
- Warlock + Demonologist Enhanced + Burgmeister Enhanced, COE5 mods by Juz
- Dominions Enhanced, Dominions 5 mod by Red_Rob and various other people
- Sombre Warhammer, Dominions 6 mod by Sombre
- Blodwold, Dominions 6 mod by Casus_Bellum
- MA Tournai, Dominions 6 mod by Speleothing (only one sprite actually, the Glass Golem. But it is very good). 
- Dominions 6 (the actual game)

## General Changes

* Ancient Forests can be capped by all classes
* Crossbows now d6 damage. At d5 they were inferior to bows even against armored targets. D5 version still exists as a "Light Crossbow" (used by pirates, hoburg crossbows etc). 
* All cavalry units are fast on world map
* Heavy infantries no longer slow. Iron cost is prohibitive enough.
* Soulless not slow on worldmap, but battleslow (less annoying, battleslow just thematic). 
* Auto-spawn stupid monsters (storm clouds, carrion, forest shepherds and revelers) eventually expire outside their favored terrains. To reduce map sprawl and general frustration. 
* Semi-magical ranged weapons (lightning, winds, tzitzimitli etc) broadly redesigned to scale less well in high numbers. 
* Blizzard spell now gets a strength check to resist. Was too easily abused. Same for Hail Storm, which also works better with the new and stronger Oni. 
* All raise dead users get some automatic sanity recovery. Encourages more liberal use, and limits the commander-ferrying. 
* Ant Hills burnable. 
* Dead forests no longer generate fungus. Makes Witches and Trolls care about keeping their trees alive. 
* Pyromancers and red kobold mages can always burn forests-> more forest fires, but all forest classes get tools to counteract.  

## Class Changes

### Baron
A clean and well-defined concept, but lacked meaningful late-game progression. This rework leans into the class's Arthurian inspiration, adding some tools to carry it through the full game.

**Key Changes:** 
* Coronation now available in all ages.
* King will unlock new elite recruits: King's Guard, Royal Bard
* King can marry a Green Enchantress, which will enable increased recruitment of Unicorn Knights for the late game. 
* The Queen can summon a an independent Fay warband once a year during summer. 
*  can promote High Lords to Knights of the Blue Rose - a unicorn riding Knight of the Round Table equivalent.  
* Unicorn knights more durable. Gains twist fate and +1 MR and can now survive battlefield wipe spells.  
* More independent mages for hire.
* Can now raise temporary field barricades to support armies.

**Minor Changes:**
* Alchemist can complete the Philosopher's Stone, gaining immortality and level 3 Alchemy (requires Higher Academy).
* Rangers added (can defend ancient forests).
* Terraforming rituals reworked a bit, in part to avoid map-wide monastery spam.
* War dogs merc recruitment, unlimited amounts can be bought. 

Inspired in part by CoExpansion. Kings Guard, Ranger- and Adventurer sprites by Sturm.

### Senator
Like the Baron, a good core design but lacked long term life goals.

**Key Changes:**
* Can designate a capital if one doesn´t already exist. Imperial Coronation and Apotheosis available in all ages.
* God Emperor and Empress are now immortal, can be used freely against powerful enemies. 
* Dark Emperor can marry and gets his own Ermor-inspired endgame.
* Fewer independent mages (that advantage went to the Baron), but expanded Imperial Cult content.
* Gains access to recruitable slingers to help with early game sieges.

**Minor changes:** 
* Can recruit Imperial War Elephants in southern citadels. Just felt appropriate. 
* Restored gold- and trade bonuses to dark emperor and god emperors. They were missing before.  

Dark Emperor inspired by Ashen Emperor Mod, capital rituals by CoExpansion.

### Demonologist
An iconic class, high risk, high reward—but a bit too volatile. Success often hinged solely on early luck and had very little to do with your opponents. This rework preserves the identity while reducing its all-or-nothing nature.

**Key Changes:**
* New set of rituals branching off Enter Soul Contract. Summoning Demonic Tutor-> Demonic Tutelage-> Greater Demonic Tutelage-> Infernal Apotheosis. Ends up as a demon, moves home citadel to Hell, and can play fully out of Inferno.
* Expanded summoning pools; many new demons.
* Gains thematic standard troops for early game.
* Can now recruit demonic legions in Inferno. 
* Can now teleport armies in- and out of inferno without subjecting Elysium to a full demonic invasion. 
* Lords of Inferno are stronger but harder to control.

**Minor changes:**
* Ice Imps are no longer obviously better than the rest. The only-summon-imps-during-winter trick felt hacky.
* Summon demon lieutenant ritual moved to tier 3.   

Demonic altar and skittering fiend sprites from Demonologist Enhanced. 

### Bakemono
Demon summoning samurai orcs. Strong theme, but in practice relied mostly on Tengu spam via the level 1 ritual. Oni felt underwhelming. This rework centers Oni as the core summon, and makes progression of the ritual tree more relevant.

**Key Changes:**
* Oni are larger, stronger, and more varied.
* Tengu reworked into aerial skirmishers with their own summoning ritual.
* Summoning pools sorted and expanded.
* New yokai were added and a few removed. More focus on the dark side of Japanese mythology rather than whimsical forest creatures. 

Oni sprites by Sturm. Wanyudo and Kojin sprites from Dominions Enhanced.  

### Troll King
Already well-rounded; changes are relatively minor and mostly thematic.

**Key Changes:**
* Can promote a ruined castle into a Goblin Castle to access Goblin King and new goblin units (e.g. Moose Riders) and more commander/caster offers. 
* Orm and Linnorm costs rebalanced to reflect their relative power (Orm cheaper)
* Mum can craft a protective necklace for her son at level 3. Gives +MR and charmres, to keep him late game relevant.
* Replacement Troll King and Old Troll available if the original dies.
* Wither Wood ritual was useless. Now reworked. Kills forest but gives some fungus at casting, short term gain vs long term pain (dead forests no longer provide mushrooms).  
* All trolls now have Swamp Walk.
* Guardian Trolls can be assigned to live under bridges (of course they can).

Wither Wood changes inspired by CoExpansion. Bridge Trolls from Large Overhaul. 

### Dwarf Queen
Nice concept, but underpowered, and late game overly reliant on ballista spam. Poor AI performance. Now more viable across the game with more strategic options and better survivability. 

**Key Changes:**
* Infantry upgrades are cheaper; ballista upgrades cost more.
* Queen's Councillors now use combat magic and upgrade to level 2.
* Can build Rune Golems as tanky, magic resistant gold-sinks.
* Dvala upgrades passively over time, also for Dvala-> Daughter of Dvalin. Divine Marriage removed.  
* Dwarf Worker spawn rate increased, especially for Daugh.
* New Ritual: Exodus. Fully upgraded Dvala can migrate (like a bee!), retaining level 3 magic while on the move, but no healing, worker spawn etc and destroys the colony. 
* Tunnelers were added for better access to Agartha. Seems appropriate. 

**Minor changes:** 
* All recruitment as mercenaries. Reduces micromanagement, and worker spawn rate is limit enough. 
* Small unit tweaks to increase utility and differentiation. Dwarf warriors better fighters than Dwarfs. Sappers are more likely to siege tunnel.  
* All magic troops get a bit more MR. 

Rune Golem sprites from Confluence. 

### Necromancer
Too strong and overloaded with options. Rebalanced for pacing and theme—less emphasis on big monsters, more about mages seeking undeath as a path to power. Bane Archers were ridiculous and are now harder to get. 

**Key Changes:**
* Mastery rituals are more expensive, now the same converted gold cost as Demonologist.
* Level 1 summon split into Hades/Elysium undead pools.
* Giant monsters removed from level 2 summoning. 
* New level 3 ritual: Greater Reanimation. Terrain-specific reanimation of very powerful undead (Death Tyrants, Dracolich etc). Functions a bit like Raise Legion; you have to actually find the remains before you can animate them.  
* New early- and mid-tier undead added.
* Bane Archers and Bane Bows only recruitable from Hades citadels. 
* Stronger summoning results and more reanimation sites in Hades. Can open paths to Hades from shadow woods + summon Gulthias trees in ancient forests to create shadow woods. Along with Bane-recruitment changes it gives a lot more interaction with Hades.   
* March of the Dead: level 3 ritual: Long distance raise dead.
* All casters now recover sanity over time to encourage use of raise dead. 
* Stygian Paths moved to demi-lich; lich gate removed. Mechanically and lore-wise they both map teleport by moving along the trails of the dead. Stygian Paths was the cool version so that stays. 
* Planar Swap + stygian path combo disabled, was way too powerful. 

**Minor changes:** 
* Many small unit tweaks. Bane Bows proc on damage, not hit. Banshee is a bit more durable. Etc. 

Some inspiration from CoExpansion and Necromantic Reorganization mods. Bane Lord sprite from Confluence. 

### Witch
Rich theme but lacked coherence—too many sources (Greek, D&D, folklore). Recentered around darker nature- and folkloric roots.

**Key Changes:**
* Summoning rituals reworked, now combined forest/swamp theme and more many new monsters.
* New rituals at level 1-3:
	o Witch's Woods. Minor enchantment that gives a bit of vision and protects forest against terrain destruction. 		Gained alongside Marshlands. Enables defensive use of Miasma without killing your own forests. Mostly 			thematic; the Witch is in pact with nature, not an ecological disaster.  
 	o Black Bloom, a reflavored version of swamp guardians. Its still stationary plants and fungus, but no crocodiles.  
 	o Shadow Summoning, a somewhat darker summoning ritual.   
 	o Hag´s cure: Heals affliction at possible cost of sanity 
 	o Witch's Sabbath: late game mass recruitment of various dark mages, including the Night Hag (who turned into a miniclass of her own).  
* Greek monsters removed (now independents).
* New more thematic Old Ones added (e.g. Great Weaver, Pale Beast, Swarm-that-Walks).
* Gains level 4 access (Dark Bargain), with new powerful rituals 
 	o Send plague (sends plagues across the map) 
 	o Great transformation (shapeshift into a black dragon)
 	o Dancing Tower (Baba Yaga inspired teleporting tower)

**Minor changes** 
* Removed free Aztlan access; too much of an optimal-play pattern. Can still go planar hopping with the Dancing Tower, but takes more effort.
* Bog Witch can exhume Bog Mummies. Bog path travel unique to her (cheaper and shorter distance).
* Manflayer gets a little ritual pool of his own.
* A few new androphag units, nothing game breaking.  
* Many minor tweaks and QOL things. Swamp walk, added a bit of poison resistance on androphags etc.  

Marsh Giant sprite from Sombre Warhammer. Rot Worm, Primordial Leech and Old Man of the Woods from Dominions Enhanced.

### Enchanter
Fun class but emptied the map too quickly. A bit depressed both to play with and against. Also suffered from ritual bloat and very high AP-costs. Redesigned for more sustainability and more eco-friendly options.

**Key Changes:**
* Less automatic terrain destruction. Wood golems have 15% to destroy forests, down from 100 for example. Greater golems still consume the site they are spawpned from. 
* New set of expensive but non-terrain destroying golems: Clay Construct, Living Mercury, Bronze Colossus, Stained Glass Golem.
* A few new terrain-consuming golems: Burning Man from coal mines, Starstone Golem from meteor craters.
* Constructs now more resistant to afflictions; can be healed in workshops of Crystal Tower. 
* Basic animation rituals auto-learned; ritual tree reorganized a bit for better flow.
* Double recruitment rate of apprentices to alleviate AP-costs;

**Minor changes** 
*  Many minor construct tweaks.

Some inspiration from OortObjects Disenchanted Apprentices mod. 
Glass Golem Sprite from MA Tournai (Speleothing). Starstone Golem sprite from Dominions Enhanced. 

### Barbarian
Identity felt scattered. Germanic tribes early on, completely replaced by Scythian amazons later. Also too fragile in late-game.

**Key Changes:**
* Fully reflavored as Germanic tribe/Conan hybrid.
* Tattoos moved to Germanic themed painted warriors and archers; Amazons removed.
* New commander: Wotan (warrior-priest with up to level 3 warrior wards).
* Can build Irminsul in Ancient Forest for increased werebear recruitment.
* Ancestral spirits are now tougher but fewer.
* Leader can become warlord and eventually King via upgrades, gaining magical tattoos and a bigger hat. Becomes strongest human warrior in the game. 
* Elite warbands recruitable at warlord status, and an income bonus at King status.
* Can raid and resettle small settlements 

Raid and resettle rituals adapted from Large_Overhaul. Wotan flavor texts much inspired by Coe4 XPMod. 
Irminsul sprite by Casus_Bellum.  

### Priest King
Many good things alongside some structural problems. Easy skipping to endgame monsters from mid-tier rituals. Shallow summoning pools nearly guaranteed success in this regard. Tzitzimitl overpowered, easy to spam, and scaled extremely well with numbers. Conversely level 1 rituals were weak and level 3 God summons overcosted. Optimal strategy was simply reaching level 2 with night/sky priest and repeating Greater Ceremony for the rest of the game.  

**Key Changes:**
* All top-tier units moved from level 2 to new level 3 summoning rituals, more options added to reduce predictability. 
* New level 2 rituals fleshed out with thematic mid-tier units instead (zotz for Night, exotic birds for Sky, dinosaurs and reptiles for Bloody mother etc).
* Tzitzimitl reworked into astronomy-casting melee combatants, still very strong but no longer as powerful in high numbers.
* Mastery costs adjusted for better pacing.

**Minor Updates:**
* Small thematic resistances and buffs added to High Priests and Holy Warriors. Various other small tweaks.

Dinosaur and Toucan sprites from Ny´s New Nations. 

### High Cultist
I like this class a lot, but Eldritch Abominations were cheap and overpowered in a boring way. Had no reasonable counters and once available, they made the rest of the class redundant. The Outer Gods felt weak for what they are.

**Key Changes:**
* Outer Gods buffed, feel more outer-God like.
* Summon Outer God pool expanded with Shoggoths, Blind Pipers and the Vessel of Dagon.
* Eldritch Abominations reworked. Conceptually similar but now with counterplay options and no longer directly overshadowing the other death gaze monsters.
* Call Outer God ritual now much more expensive.

**Minor Additions:**
* Added a ritual "Something Under the Pyramids" ritual for Nyarlathotep. Adapted from Large_Overhaul. Its just fluff. The original author removed it from his mod, but I liked it.

Entire lineup of Deep One sprites was replaced with sprites from Sturm. 

### High Priestess
Very cool class, especially her late game content - which you almost never got to see as she mostly snowballed across the map in a scourged-earth Anakite rush. Lacked long-term sustainability and was frustrating to play against since you would often die early or live to see an empty map. Reworked for sustainability and depth of gameplay.

**Key Changes:**
* Gains access to Dark Blessings (obvious why she hadn´t previously, but still felt like an omission).
* Blood Feast rituals are now more costly, but safer for cities.
* Baal significantly strengthened, now feels like the ultimate evil of Elysium. 
* Zamzummite necromancy split into a dedicated ritual branch.
* Banquet for the Dead no longer mirrors Greater Blood Feast. It now consumes the caster, in a macabre alternative to grand mastery.

**Minor Changes**
* Several new units: Gileadite Archer, Amorite Spearman, Gibborim War Chariot, Baalite Hornblower.
* Assassin recruitment chance now scales with temple count.
* Magical giants gain magical swords.
* Ditanu buffed to reflect their heroic lore. 
* Second Sun summons flame spirits to guard the enchanted square.

Class structure inspired by XPMod (CoE4) which I think did a good job of it. Baalite Hornblower + neat flavor text copied from Large Overhaul.
### Kobold King
Well-contained concept, but pretty weak. Small changes mostly.

**Key Changes:**
* Mastery rituals are cheaper.
* Higher recruitment chance of drakes and dragon spawn chiefs
* Black Kobolds are buffed a bit, and gain a new Spider Rider unit.
* New set of dragon-tamer rituals, can convince the dragon to remain in lair or go attacking surroundings for a brief period.  
* Can build Defensive Warren — adds ambushing kobolds to stronghold defenses.

**Minor Changes:**
* Frost Drakes now have snow stealth, Wyvern Riders slightly more durable. Dragons get slightly more HP and morale + a little higher chance of spawning with items. 

### Scourge Lord
Cool premise, but half the lore felt like it belonged in another game. Also wonky power curve – very weak start, but spiraled uncontrollably once he reached a critical mass. Reflavored (removed the mind worm graffiti and breeding pits), and power progression made less exponential.

**Key Changes:**
* Many changes to the unit roster. Dark desert themes with ghouls, djinns, and corrupted elementals. Mutated animals are mostly gone.
* All flavor texts rewritten. 
* Scourge King can now ascend to level 4, becoming a dark demi-god. Can summon map roaming Spheres of Anti-life. 
* Dark Blessings are more expensive. I wanted to remove the upper limit, but not possible. 
* Teleportation limited to owned pyramids. Wide classes now have some counterplay against a Scourge Lord doomstack. 
* Number of Heralds capped at 12 and Scourge Lords at 3. Limits the self-perpetuating loop of commanders summoning commanders, and necessitates actual units in the late game.  

**Minor Changes:**
* Some sprite updates.
* Mountain of Power removed - it wasn´t useful, and pyramids of Doom are ominous enough.
* Less life force gained from water squares. You actually need to conquer the world now. 

Spheres of Anti-life sprites are from Ny's New Nations. Great Ghoul sprite from Confluence. Slaver Sprite from Dominions Nation Pack (Juhera). Uses CoExpansion hacks to get lore accurate sprites for the Scourge Lords, I wouldnt have figured that one out by myself.   

### Monkey Maharaja
The class felt mechanically complete, but a bit shallow outside of the gem-rituals. Their unique reincarnation mechanic was fun, but felt peripheral as it required finding a temple on the map to work. 

**Key Changes:**
* Yogi can establish Ashrams in Atavi villages. Functions as a temple.
* New ritual: Establish Atavi Village.
* New ritual: Akashic Wards (protects settlements from undead/demons).
* Starts with a yogi for early gem collection.
* A new line of white one warrior units - high MR Vanara soldiers and tiger riders available, recruitment offers scale with number of temples (Yogi offers scale with libraries). 
* The cool but useless Inhabit Lake and Inhabit Jungle rituals have been restructured to offer more practical value.

Atavi Village ritual copied from CoExpansion

### Raksharaja
Well-designed overall. Minor thematic and balance adjustments.

**Key Changes:**
* Rakshasa now count as demonic (affected by Akashic Wards).
* Establish Atavi Village added.
* Lanka summon costs reduced, to balance against Naraka Summoning. 
* New ritual: Manifestation of Maya — roaming illusionary armies.

Maya Manifestation ritual lifted from Large Overhaul. Very fitting and the best idea I could find for the Rakshasa. Atavi Village from CoE Expanded.

### Pale Ones
Strong theme, but required many-many-many emeralds to function. Early agartha access wasn´t much of an advantage, since it was mostly a wall of rock. Pale One units held back by losing their eye constantly.

**Key Changes:**
* Mastery rituals now split gem costs according to magic paths, not all in emeralds.  
* Cheaper oracles with smaller entourages. More flexible to use this way. 
* New utility rituals: Tremor Sense (scry surface from Agartha) and Earth Shaping (dig). Guerilla warfare from below.  
* Pale Ones gain increased affliction resistance.
* Earth Made Flesh can learn all spells in known schools. Gives guaranteed access to regeneration. 
* Agartha is significantly expanded and Pale ones get natural access. A big indirect buff. 

**Minor Changes:**
* Troglodytes are recruitable like war dogs (as per lore), gain siege tunneling.
* Shard Guards lose tunneling, gain sweep attack.
* A few summoned monsters added for variety.

### Illusionist
Great flavor, but uneven ritual balance and ritual clutter especially at level 2. Smoothed out and some stuff for added flavor. Not really room for more rituals. 

**Key Changes:**
* New recruits: False Giants, Flying Monkeys. 
* New phase summon: Ether Kite.
* Standard recruits are mercenaries clad in golden uniforms—fake, of course.
* Capture Spell rituals cheaper and apprentices always learn the level 1 version.
* Reduced chance of starting with niche utility rituals.
* Simulacrum ritual grows more expensive and is capped at 3. 

**Minor Changes:**
* Minor tweaks (mirrors summon closer to front line, gain affliction resistance etc)

False Giants and golden mercs from Confluence. Simulacrum ritual cap copied from Large Overhaul.

### Voice of El
Has a unique theme centered on heavenly intervention beyond the player's control. That's part of its charm, so I didn't want to change it too much—but it needed more player agency and more reliable early game. (Some core mechanics remain hardcoded and cannot be modded without a full rebuild.)

**Key Changes:**
* Expanded standard recruitment options:
	* Sergeants-at-Arms (durable ranged support)
	* Chaplains (holy captains)
	* Vespertine Agents (holy assassins)
	* Battle Reliquaries (bless and protect nearby troops)
* Paladins can be upgraded via ritual; gain healing and restoration rituals, mostly fluff. 
* Starting army now includes archers.
* Bishops know more spells from start, to increase chance of access to conversion.
* The Pope buffed a bit to reflect level 4 caster status.
* Ophans from the 6th Seal are now stronger, felt like a downgrade from 5th seal previously. 

Sprites: Vespertine Agent sprite from the Gathering Sturm. 

### Warlock
The Air Warlock was far stronger than the others, mostly due to doomstackable air elementals. All elemental paths have been rebalanced for better parity and deeper summoning pools.

Giant mechanics were odd — Despite their size, they were underwhelming in melee due to single-target attacks and low power density. Also, titans could make giants, who became titans, who made more giants. As long as one lived, you could regrow an endless army. Like a sourdough starter. The whole thing just felt a bit off. 

**Key Changes:**
* Air elementals completely reworked — now in line with the other elementals.
* Each pact now includes access to its respective elemental plane.
* Giants are acquired individually, and their leaders are rare and no longer lab-grown titans.
* All giants now have trample or small AOE. 
* Summoning pools expanded.
* Perpetual Storm ritual reworked. Now a more localized area denial + resource generator, doesn´t cover entire map in elementals while burning your CPU. 

**Other Changes:**
* All paraelemental weapons elemental damage proc on damage, not on hit. Mostly affects Mist Warriors. 
* Elemental Champions now themed with more personality.
* Elemental royalty gain more distinctive visuals and are more expensive (now twice the cost of a Kobold King!).
* New rituals:
	* Send Tsunami (water. Guess what it does)
	* Cloud Trapeze (Air. Teleport from a mountaintop in a spectacular fashion.)
* Cloud Castle moved to Cloud Lord.

Storm Giant and Champion of Flames sprites from Confluence. Frost Giant Sprites from Niefel Sprite upgrade mod.   

### Cloud Lord
Much more distinct from the warlock, refashioned as the true master of the sky realm.

**Key Changes:**
* Summoning pools and ritual pools adjusted for less overlap with Warlock.
* More Cloudfolk recruits added if Cloud Lord captures a cloud city (nobles, knights, flying ships)
* Can recruit giants from Beanstalk Castles.
* Can recruit monks and mammoth riders from mountain spire monasteries (new terrain). 
* Nimbus Conclave ritual: three Cloud Casters form a thundercloud assault platform.
* New late-game unit: Silent Kings — immortal oracles from the Cloud Palace.
* Can construct Rainbow prisms for defense.
* Sky Plane greatly expanded and now worth conquering. 

Eagle Guard copied from Large Overhaul. 

### Burgmeister
The Burgmeister now has two distinct end-game paths:, Horology, culminating in the Steel Chancellor or Horticulture, leading to the High Gardener. Each path unlocks unique monsters and mechanics. Ents removed (now unique to the Druid), but can summon Topiary Guardians instead, which felt more appropriate for a garden themed nation.  

**Key Changes:**
* The Steel Chancellor can construct Hoburg Manufactories.
* The High Gardener can transform Hoburg villages into Great Gardens (new terrain).
* New recruitable units: Aeronaut Corps, Hoburg Handgunner, Eagle Rider and Elephant Hog. 
* Looses access to Ents (now unique to the Druid) but can instead summon Topiary Guardians.  
* New minor defensive ritual: Plant Strangleweed

**Minor Tweaks:**
* Clockwork constructs no longer fully immune to elemental damage.
* Lightning attacks reworked for balance.

Dual paths concept taken from Large Overhaul. I changed some things, but the main structure is the same. Aeronaut Corps + Elephant Hog are from Burgmeister Enhanced.

### Markgraf
Lacked a niche of his own, was just a lesser Necromancer with no unique assets. Reworked extensively and the Markgraf is now a vicious little class of his own. Equal parts petty lord, occult experimenter, and undead industrialist.

**Markgraf Leader:**
* Gains his own ritual path, starting with economy-focused undead labor reforms. Eventually gains ghoul- or vampire-flavored occult powers.
* Can collaborate with a Grand Nekromant to build a secret laboratory, where he may eventually be transformed into a vampire.
* Markgraf units can be given "extended service contracts", allowing them to rise again as soulless versions after death.

**Nekromant:**
* Loses most necromancy rituals, but learns vivisection, employing animal electricity, illicitly imported clockwork tech and alchemy. Can create flesh golems, clockwork augmented soulless, suicide-bombing corpses, and so on.
* Sole access to Flesh Golems and Necrotods which are no longer available to the Enchanter.
* I added in a smattering of toxicologists, murderers, corpse-flinging catapults, rats in the walls, and a headless horseman for good measure.
* Gameplay is highly dependent on corpses for reanimation—fortunately, the Markgraf is quite skilled at producing a steady supply.

Most of the new soulless and golem sprites are from Confluence. Black Hood sprites by Sturm.  

### Druid
Excellent design overall. Mostly polish. The primal summoning ritual felt a bit off - depopulated the primal plane for no particularly good reason, and made Ents a disappointing fail-summon.  

**Key Changes:**
* Wild Hunt buffed and grows stronger over time if not stopped. Moved to level 3. 
* Can regrow any forest (but takes time. Fire is still a valid counter).
* Forest Shepherds now slower and eventually die outside forests.
* Level 3 summoning rituals reorganized into:
	* Summon Forest God (Primal gods only, no ents or beholders). More expensive to make up for consistency. 
	* Summon Primal Being (Ents, Monster Boars, Beholders etc, and new additions like Smilodons and Faery Dragons. No depopulation of the plane.)

**Minor Improvements:**
* Huts count as forests.

Smilodon Sprites from Dominions Enhanced. The Faery Dragon and Elder Beholder sprite are from Confluence. 

### Dryad Queen
Thematically strong, but mechanically underpowered. Bad at capping forests, and spawning rates felt too low. Despite an impressively dedicated effort by the Discord community it seems very hard to get a grasp on the underlying numbers, so I don´t really know how to fix it.  

**Key Changes:**
* Gains Incite Revelry from the Senator — more on-theme and helps early economy and forest control.
* Spawn rate bonus increased by 50% across the board.  
* Can regrow forests like the druid. 
* Herb rituals buffed a bit and summoning results now scale properly with grove level.
* Centaurs are fast. 

**Minor stuff:** 
* Harpies buffed a bit. 

## Planar Content

### Agartha
* Now spawns with a big interconnected tunnel system (built by a ton of burrowing worms that die after turn 20)
* New terrains, monsters, and treasures: ooze colonies in slime pools, black kobold lairs, forgotten underground ruins, buried naga city, a vast fungal forest harboring an ancient god-fungus etc. 
* Ressource density increased a bit 

### Sky Realm
* Higher resource density and more populated. All cloud settlements produce one more gold. Always spawn 1 Cloud City. 
* Several new terrains (mountaintop monasteries, roc nests, sky pools etc), with some unique recruitables. 
* New sprite for cloud grave yards to something more appropriate for an aerial realm.  

### Celestial Realm
* Always contains two Sacred Cities (heavily defended)
* Abrasax and the Heavenly Bastion are significantly stronger—killing God should be hard. Good luck. 
* Celestial recruitment available at holy castles (non-Infernal classes only).

### Inferno
* Citadels remain well defended even if demon lords depart.
* New demon types from the Demonologist rework added for flavor.

### Primal Plane
* Sidhe recruitment now available at Mag Mell.
* Smilodons roam the mountains and Faery Dragons the Wild Forests. 

### Aztlan
* Thematic recruitment added to the holy cities. Nothing super powerful but felt a bit empty before.  

Worldroof warriors, mammoths and monks from Dominions Nation Pack. 

## AI Rework
Many AI-pointers and a bunch of hacks for smarter and less frustrating behavior.

**Key Changes:**
* AI now uses almost all tools available, including multi-dependency rituals. Chance of using rituals are weighted by utility and flavor. 
* Lower risk of accidental apocalypse: the AI won't open Infernal Gates in random places and so on.
* Summoned defenders and enchantments are cast in strategic locations, not randomly across the map.
* AI prioritizes leveling up mages instead of endlessly casting low-level rituals.
* AI prioritizes higher tier monsters once their army reaches a decent size. 
* Siege weapons are used both offensively and defensively.
* Limits added to AI siege weapon spam in walled settlements.
* Thematic garrisons now form in key locations (home citadels, king's castles, etc.), scaling in strength as the game progresses.
* AI is less likely to leave cities and forts undefended.  

**Suicide prevention:**
* AI home citadels are invulnerable for the first 5 turns.
* If the AI loses its starting commander early, it gets an offer for a new one. Reduces early-game suicide runs.

**Class-Specific AI Tweaks:**
* Dwarf Queen now plays patiently—building up forces and spreading from mountain to mountain, rather than sending lone commanders all over the place. Some AI cheating involved in getting it to work. 
* Markgraf will always build secret labs and actually become a vampire. Also some cheating here. 
* Baron and Senator will complete coronations and marriages if they have the ressources. 
* Terrain-destroying classes are given less destructive options, and the AI is encouraged to use them.
* Terrain destructive rituals mostly used on enemy side of the map. 
* Kobold King will be more diligent with defensive and lair upgrading rituals.
* Dryad Queen will park commanders on groves to increase spawning rate. 

## Thoughts for the future, in random order: 
* Make AI spawn optimized armies (easy to do, but a lot of manual work. I may get around to it). 
* One more imperial cult (mithras inspired veiled bull, Tauroforus? Cult of merchants, gold-themed, Aurelion?) 
* More content for Pale Ones. Lean into mastery of Agartha (monsters with agartha-shape to simulate dark vision?). 
* Elemental (Warlock + Pale Ones) summoning pools are still too shallow. But hard to come up with stuff that´s not just the bland "Element x, creature Y" formula.   
* Much more distinct Elemental Royalty (my lack of drawing skills stopped all progress)
* Not satisfied with War Priest summoning line for Priest King. 
* More special sites in water: treasure island, zombie reef, great corals etc. 
* More sky terrains: dragon aviaries, shimmering caves, Tower of Silence, singular inhabited "islands". 
* More special items (Legion of Gods should maybe have something unique).
* Druid: angle of interaction with cities/non-forest citadels. Verdant Enclaves.
* Aztlan could use some more unique content. 
* More emphasis on ambush mechanics. Would require a scout rework, and I'm not sure it's a good idea overall.
