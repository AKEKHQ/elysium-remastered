descr "While it is easy to assume the King is the sole ruler of the kingdom, any married man knows that being the master of one’s own household is more fiction than fact. The royal marriage is no exception. Though the King holds the formal title, the Queen may well be the true power behind the throne. Our Queen, hailing from a distant and mystical land, commands immense respect among the commoners—and more than a little awe. Rumors abound that she is a magician, and there may be truth to them. Since her arrival, the forests have grown wilder, and sightings of unicorns have become strangely frequent. Coincidence? The court wisely avoids asking."

While their official duty is to safeguard the Royal Castle, in practice, they are frequently dispatched to deal with perceived threats to the King. Whether or not those threats are real, the King’s Guard remains ever ready to prove that the best defense is preemptive."
