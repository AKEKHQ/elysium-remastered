descr "Elephants, the largest animals known to man, are trained for use in battle. Their sheer size allows them to trample soldiers and horses. Elephants are intelligent beings with minds of their own. Once hurt, they become enraged and terrified, seeking to leave the battlefield by the shortest possible route and trampling friends and enemies alike."

descr "When elephants were first introduced in the Imperial armies, the Cult of the Conquering Sun were quick to see their potential. The Cult acquired several of these magnificent beasts, and mounted some of their more adventurous heliodromi on top. This made for some rather spectacular sermons, and gave them a significant publicity advantage over their rival cults. It also turned out to be quite useful in combat, although the beasts have a tendency to panick from the bright light of the spells. But at the very least the spectacle is undeniable."

descr "The Thaumaturgs are wandering mystics who live in secluded caves, and claim to be able to perform miracles. While their magical skills are surely exaggerated, they do appear to have some measure of control over the weather, and can summon rain or raise fires on demand. They are therefore in high standing with the peasantry, but due to their strange ways, rarely tolerated for long within the civilized cities."

descr "Being a former mage and imperial mistress, the Empress now wields considerable power from her throne.  It is said that she still shares some loyalties to her order of mages, but any such suggestion is widely dismissed and ought not to be uttered in groups larger than three.  The newly minted wedding coins with the face of the Empress are quite popular within the College, and our headmaster seems to have an abundant supply."

newmonster "God Empress of the Underworld"
descr "Some claim that a divine status was the ultimate goal of the Empress, and something her magical order has striven for for generations.  However, everyone who has claimed to possess evidence has since left the Empire, often on a solitary quest to defeat the Troll King. The Empress herself is a great patron of the sciences, and has made very generous donations to our College to support our relentless pursuit of knowledge. It is understood that the Empress herself is not a suitable subject for study."

descr "Throughout the Legion, archery was considered unmanly and therefore best left to foreigners. Following the debacle of the siege of Axtatur, it was however generally agreed that it would be preferable to be able to return fire on ranged enemy fighters. The scorpio was therefore introduced. It works on the same principle as the ballista, but is scaled down to be portable by a single solider. It still large enough however to be considered a proper weapon for a man."
