descr "In ancient times the Emperor would have put up statues of himself in any major settlement.  This has often been described as an act of vanity by many historians.  However, a few opposing theories have been put forth.  By sharing his image in both statues and coins, the Emperor would be present in the mind of every citizen.  When such an awareness reaches a certain level, it would give the Emperor a sort of divine focus or divine aegis if he so desires.  This can then be redirected and focused through the statues and there has been speculation that it would keep the citizens calm, giving them a sense of being watched at all times - which would explain the elaborate eyes in many statues. Another more sinister theory states the statues erected by Vasilis the Putrid somehow siphoned power from the living population to sustain his undead legions."

descr "The first Renatus was the eldest member of the Renatae, a keeper of records, and the last in a bloodline bred for magical aptitude. Though his magic was unremarkable compared to other mages of the realm, he somehow stumbled upon the secret to immortality. He passed this knowledge to a select group of apprentices, though, curiously, only male members of the order succeeded in following his method. The path to immortality, as devised by the first Renatus, involves a peculiar mix: alchemical residues, a strong magical affinity, a strict frugal diet, and absolute celibacy. Unsurprisingly, the latter two have dissuaded most alchemists from attempting this route, grumbling that there must be an easier—or at least more enjoyable—way. Hieronyma the Clouded, a prominent skeptic, insists that a Renatus isn't truly immortal. Instead, she claims the order has perfected a method of creating body and mind duplicates of each Renatus, stored in ancient basins beneath their main palace. According to her, when one "Renatus" dies, another copy simply takes his place. Although the male Renati are regarded as the order’s public leaders, rumors persist of a secret cabal of old Renatae pulling strings from the shadows with the lofty aim of creating the perfect human. While there’s no evidence to support such claims, many heroes boast of their success in seducing a local Renata."

descr "When elephants were first introduced to the Imperial armies, the Cult of the Conquering Sun quickly recognized their potential. They procured several of these majestic creatures and mounted their more daring heliodromi on top, creating a platform for truly spectacular sermons and securing a notable publicity advantage over rival cults. While initially a triumph of showmanship, the war elephants proved surprisingly effective in combat, though their tendency to panic under the bright flashes of heliodromi spells added a degree of unpredictability to the battlefield."

descr "In old times any construction of bridges and temples as well as any declaration of war demanded a sacrifice of a hecatomb to the Elysian pantheon.  An Elysian hecatomb is one hundred sheep, some of which may be goats instead as long as they can be kept under control.  The sacrifices were performed by the Flamen, who wielded considerable power at the time.  In order to balance that power, the Flamen was limited in several ways and still is.  He may not touch iron, meat, beans or living horses.  He is always required to wear the Flamen headdress, even when sleeping, and he may not look at a drawn weapon.  Some of the more creative Emperors of old added to the lists of what a Flamen could and should do.  After the gods had demanded a particularly vast number of hecatombs from Emperor Reus IV, the Emperor ruled that when the Flamen spoke on non-religious matters, he had to bow to the senior member of the Senate between each syllable.^With new cults appearing, these sacrifices became less and less important, and today the Flamen's sacrifices mainly concern less important things, such as weddings, the inauguration of a new porch and similar events. Nonetheless, the Flamen maintain the old ways and commune regularly with eudaimons of the land.

descr "Thaumaturgs are self-proclaimed miracle workers who practice magic for coin. Their skills are typically passed down through master-apprentice relationships, though many are largely self-taught. They are loosely connected but operate independently, with little allegiance to the great Cults. While their magical abilities are often exaggerated, they do possess some control over the elements, such as influencing the weather or igniting fires on command. Successful Thaumaturgs often find favor among the senatorial elite, while others earn their living by summoning rain or selling lucky charms to peasants."
