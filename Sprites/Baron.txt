descr "Alchemists like to brew potions that explode when smashed, competing to make the biggest and prettiest explosions. Of course no alchemist would dream of using this in battle himself and endangering his life, instead heavily armoured infantry are equipped with mostly flame resistant garb and given a single potion to throw. The chance of spontaneous explosion or forest fire while marching is an acceptable risk to bring the damage they can deal to flamable foes such as trolls or walking trees."
